				<li><b> SELFLESS </b></li>
				<P>Being slefless is one of the traits that he can be very proud of. He always put others first and sometimes ignore his needs to satisfy others'. He made sure that everyone else is happy even if he's not. This may be equally one of his flaws. He would gladly accept being taken advantage because he's afraid of confronting people. Whenever I have a breakdown, he's there, he's like the piece of string I cling to, pulling me from my thoughts of giving up. It won't matter if he breaks himself in the process, because for him, as long as he held me up, he's be the happiest for me. He would lose himself if it would mean someone would finally find themselves.  </p>
				<br>
				<li><b> STRAIGHTFORWARD </b></li>
				<p> When you're suffering from something, he doesn't give you unnecessary comfort but instead addresses the probblem and helps you in any way he can. He would act empathetic at first but won't waste so much time for that for he knows that regretting is useless and the only way to get through any problem is to solve it, not cry about it. He lets you hear what you don't want, but what you need. He gives you the truth and nothing else. His realness is contagious. When I cried to him about a personal matter, he comforted me for a while and after that, made me realize my regrets and abruptly following it with a statement saying that he already pointed out my lapses and that all I can do now is to think of a solution. He helped me find that solution and I'm ever so grateful for it. </p>
				<br>
				<li><b> STAUNCH </b></li>
				<p> Whenever he sets on something, he will work hard for it. The same as when he gives you a role in his life, he'll do what he can for you to have that role for eternity. He treats his friends as his family and  not one soul will be able to say the he lacks effort in relationships because his dedication to his family and friends is one of a kind. He is the kind of person who would run a thousand kilometers just to give you what you need. He would make an effort to solve mmisunderstandings between you two because hw doesn't want to lose you.</p>
				<br>
				<li><b> SWEET </b></li>
				<p> He is that person who would tear his exam paper and eat it in front of you when you found out you didn't pass the exam. The kind of person who would give you security and would not hesitate to go to you when he senses that something is wrong with you. He is an introvert but he would go out of his way to accompany you when you're uncomfortable. He has a God-complex but would follow your religious rituals. He would accompany you to wait for a ride when it's dark and you're alone. His hugs just makes your day a whole lot better.</p>
				<br>
				<li><b> SINCERE </b></li>
				<p> He would never say something half-meant or something he didn't mean at all. When he promises to be this and that, you can be sure that he will. One time, he said he'd stay up all night to check in on me once in a while and he did at 2:00 AM and at 3:00 AM, sacrificing his sleep to be with you. When he says he'll take care of you, he will. When he says he'd be there, you know he will be. No need for the "actions speak louder than words" because his actions are guaranteed by his words. </p>
				<br>
				<li><b> SUPPORTIVE </b></li>
				<p> It doesn't matter if you're doing something weird or something productive, you can almost always hear his cheer in your mind. He never failed to be there when you needed any kind of support, whether literally or metaphorically. He pushes you to go out of your comfort zone and encourages you to take big risks, and he'd let you know that whatever the result may be, he's there to catch you when you fail and bring you up when you succeed. He makes you confident in what you do and makes you forget ypur doubts. That kind of support is scond to nothing. </p>
